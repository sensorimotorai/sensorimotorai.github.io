- Presenter: Gerardo Duran-Martin (the first author)

We started by introducing the [RL Debate Series]({{ "/debates/" | relative_url }}), we then proceeded to discuss BONE. Many thanks to Gerardo for a very clear presentation! BONE is a dense paper, but Gerardo's amazing presentation makes is easy to understand the main ideas.
