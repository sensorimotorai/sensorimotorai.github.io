In our 4th [RL Debates]({{ "/debates/" | relative_url }}) presentation, Adam presented broad topics on RL and the brain, including his distributional RL paper.

- Paper: [An opponent striatal circuit for distributional reinforcement learning](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-024-08488-5){:target="_blank"}

- Presenter: Adam Lowet

Adam's talk covered a lot of ground. He presented his recent work on **distributional RL**, which provides causal evidence that the brain computes a full probability distribution of value rather than a single number. He showed evidence for an **opponent circuit in the striatum** that could perform this function. He then placed this finding within a broader discussion of the open challenges in linking RL theory to complex, real-world brain function and behavior.
